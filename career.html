        <h3>Professional Interests</h3>    
         <p>
            Although I have not really settled on what kind of career I want to pursue I do have some interests and roles I would like to explore and learn more about. Software development has always been a interest of mine although I admit I am not great at it, at the moment I am taking a programming class to strengthen my java skills. Networking and cyber security is also another career path that I have considered, I find it quite interesting and I believe that with the way technology is advancing this will be a very interesting field in the future.

        <h3>A bit about myself</h3>
       
        <p>
            My name is Matthew, I'm a full time student from Australia and I'm currently on exchange for a semester. Back in Sydney I'm working towards a Bachelor's degree in Business and Information Technology at the University of Technology, Sydney, majoring in Finance and Networking Engineering. I'm currently in the third year of my four year degree.

        <h3>My time in New York so far</h3>
        
        <p>
            This is my first time in the New York and the United States so I have quite a few places I want to visit. However, I have had to adjust to living here so I haven't really had the chance to explore the city. So far the places I've visited in the city are Battery Park, One World Trade Centre and Wall St.
                <br>
            I have things I want to do and see in the United States before I head back to Australia though. These are:
